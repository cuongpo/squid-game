# 🔧 Round Narrative Reset Fix - COMPLETE!

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

You reported: *"when finish round 1 - I click next round - it show Game Narrative round 1 again - then show round 2"*

**I've completely fixed this issue!** The narrative now properly resets between rounds.

## 🐛 **Root Cause**

The problem was in the `simulateNextRound` function. It was **appending** new round narrative to the existing narrative array instead of **replacing** it:

### ❌ **Before (The Bug)**
```typescript
roundNarrative: [
  ...gameState.roundNarrative,  // ← Kept ALL previous rounds
  ...setupNarrative             // ← Added new round on top
],
```

This caused:
- Round 1: Shows "Round 1: Red Light Green Light..."
- Round 2: Shows "Round 1: Red Light Green Light..." + "Round 2: Tug of War..."
- Round 3: Shows Round 1 + Round 2 + Round 3 narrative

## ✅ **The Fix**

I made three key changes:

### **1. Clear Narrative for Each New Round**
```typescript
// In simulateNextRound()
roundNarrative: setupNarrative, // ← Start fresh with only current round
```

### **2. Reset Narrative When Preparing Next Round**
```typescript
// In resetRoundState()
gameState: {
  ...state.gameState,
  pendingRoundResult: undefined,
  roundNarrative: [] // ← Clear narrative for next round
}
```

### **3. Proper Round Transition**
The `handleNextRound` function now:
1. Calls `resetRoundState()` to clear previous narrative
2. Calls `simulateNextRound()` to start fresh
3. Resets `currentNarrativeIndex` to 0

## 🎮 **How to Test the Fix**

**Your app is running at: http://localhost:5174/**

1. **Start a new game**
2. **Place some bets**
3. **Begin simulation and complete Round 1**
4. **Click "Next Round"**
5. **✅ You should now see ONLY Round 2 narrative** (no Round 1 repetition)

## 🎯 **Before vs After**

### **❌ Before (The Problem)**
```
Round 1 completes → Click "Next Round"
Narrative shows:
- "Round 1: Red Light Green Light..."
- "Players must freeze when..."
- "Round 2: Tug of War..."  ← Round 2 mixed with Round 1
```

### **✅ After (Fixed!)**
```
Round 1 completes → Click "Next Round"
Narrative shows:
- "Round 2: Tug of War..."  ← Only Round 2 narrative
- "Teams must be formed..."
- Clean, fresh start for each round
```

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Files Modified**
- `src/stores/gameStore.ts` - Fixed narrative accumulation logic

### **Key Changes**
1. **Line 189**: Changed from `...gameState.roundNarrative,` to just `setupNarrative`
2. **Line 400**: Added `roundNarrative: []` to `resetRoundState()`
3. **Comments**: Added clear documentation about the fix

### **Flow Control**
```
Round completes → resetRoundState() → Clear narrative
Next round starts → simulateNextRound() → Fresh narrative only
Narrative displays → Only current round content
```
