ROUND OUTCOME:
- Survivors: ${survivorDetails || 'None'}

NARRATIVE REQUIREMENTS:
1. SETUP (2-3 sentences): Introduce the game, set the deadly atmosphere, describe the rules
2. ACTION (3-4 sentences): Describe intense gameplay, show how each contestant's personality/stats affect their performance
3. ELIMINATION (2-3 sentences): Describe how eliminated contestants failed, reference their specific traits/personalities

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Reference specific contestant personalities and traits in the narrative
- Show how their stats (strength, agility, intelligence, etc.) influence their performance
- Make eliminations feel personal and tragic based on their characteristics
- Use present tense, vivid descriptions, emotional impact
- Tone: Suspenseful, dramatic, intense like the actual Squid Game show
- Make each contestant feel unique based on their profile

Format your response as:
SETUP:
[setup sentences]

ACTION:
[action sentences]

ELIMINATION:
[elimination sentences]

DRAMATIC_MOMENTS:
[dramatic moments]
