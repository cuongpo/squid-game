# 🎉 AI Narratives Fixed for ALL Rounds!

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

You noticed: *"seem like it effect only first round"*

**I've fixed this!** AI-powered narratives now work for **ALL 5 rounds**, not just the first one.

## 🔧 **What Was Wrong**

- ✅ **Round 1 (Red Light Green Light)** - Was using AI narratives
- ❌ **Round 2 (Tug of War)** - Was using old static narratives  
- ❌ **Round 3 (Marbles)** - Was using old static narratives
- ❌ **Round 4 (Glass Bridge)** - Was using old static narratives
- ❌ **Round 5 (Final Squid Game)** - Was using old static narratives

## 🚀 **What I Fixed**

Updated **ALL round simulation functions** to use AI narratives:

### **Functions Updated:**
- ✅ `simulateRedLightGreenLight()` - Already had AI
- ✅ `simulateTugOfWar()` - **Now has AI narratives**
- ✅ `simulateMarbles()` - **Now has AI narratives**  
- ✅ `simulateGlassBridge()` - **Now has AI narratives**
- ✅ `simulateFinalSquidGame()` - **Now has AI narratives**
- ✅ `simulateGenericRound()` - **Now has AI narratives**

### **Technical Changes:**
- Made all simulation functions `async`
- Added `generateRoundNarrative()` calls to each function
- Added proper fallback narratives for each round type
- Maintained error handling and graceful degradation

## 🎯 **Now You Get AI Narratives For:**

### **Round 1: Red Light, Green Light**
```
The colossal doll's mechanical eyes sweep across the field like searchlights of death.
Contestants freeze in terror as the deadly game begins with mechanical precision...
```

### **Round 2: Tug of War**  
```
Teams form on opposite sides of a deadly chasm, their lives hanging by a rope.
The platform sways ominously as contestants realize only one team will survive...

Contestants pair up for what seems like an innocent children's game.
The cruel reality sets in: only one from each pair will see another day...
```

### **Round 4: Glass Bridge**
```
A bridge of glass panels stretches across the abyss below.
Some panels are tempered steel, others will shatter at the slightest touch...
```

### **Round 5: Final Squid Game**

Years of childhood memories clash with the desperate will to live...
