# 🎯 Round 3 (Marbles) Problem Fixed!

## ✅ **Problem Identified & Solved**

You reported: *"round 1 round 2 ok - there is problem with round 3"*

**I found and fixed the issue!** There was a bug in the Marbles simulation function that was causing Round 3 to fail.

## 🐛 **What Was Wrong**

### **The Bug**
In the `simulateMarbles()` function, there was leftover code that tried to use a `narrative` variable before it was declared:

```typescript
// This line was causing the error:
narrative.push(`${lastContestant.contestant.name} advances automatically due to odd numbers.`);

// But 'narrative' wasn't declared until later in the function!
let narrative: string[] = []; // This came later
```

### **Why It Happened**
When I updated all the round functions to use AI narratives, I removed the old narrative generation but missed cleaning up one reference to the old `narrative` array in the Marbles function.

## 🔧 **What I Fixed**

### **Before (Broken)**
```typescript
// Handle odd number of contestants
if (shuffled.length % 2 === 1) {
  const lastContestant = shuffled[shuffled.length - 1];
  survivors.push(lastContestant);
  narrative.push(`${lastContestant.contestant.name} advances automatically due to odd numbers.`); // ❌ ERROR
}
```

### **After (Fixed)**
```typescript
// Handle odd number of contestants
if (shuffled.length % 2 === 1) {
  const lastContestant = shuffled[shuffled.length - 1];
  survivors.push(lastContestant); // ✅ WORKS
  // Removed the problematic narrative.push line
}
```

## 🎮 **What This Means**

### **Round 3: Marbles Now Works Perfectly**
- ✅ **Proper pairing** of contestants for marble games
- ✅ **AI-generated narratives** about the psychological warfare
- ✅ **Elimination logic** based on contestant effectiveness
- ✅ **Enhanced prompts** with contestant characteristics and stats
- ✅ **No more crashes** or undefined variable errors

### **Expected Round 3 AI Narratives**
```
Round 3: Marbles
Contestants pair up for what seems like an innocent children's game, but the cruel 
reality sets in: only one from each pair will see another day.

Jihoon's cautious personality and high intelligence (9) help him read his opponent's 
tells, while his strategic nature allows him to manipulate the marble count effectively.

Minseo's aggressive nature and deception skills (8) serve her well in the psychological 
warfare, but her low luck (3) nearly costs her everything in the final moments.

Hyejin's empathetic personality becomes her downfall - her caring nature prevents her 
from fully committing to the deception needed to survive this cruel game.
```

## 🔍 **Technical Details**

### **Root Cause**
- **Variable scope issue**: Reference to undefined `narrative` variable
- **Incomplete refactoring**: Missed cleaning up old code during AI integration
- **JavaScript error**: `ReferenceError: narrative is not defined`

### **Fix Applied**
- ✅ **Removed problematic line** that referenced undefined variable
- ✅ **Maintained game logic** for odd number of contestants
- ✅ **Preserved AI narrative generation** later in the function
- ✅ **Tested all round functions** to ensure no similar issues

### **✅ Round 2: Tug of War** - AI narratives working  
### **✅ Round 3: Marbles** - **FIXED** - AI narratives working
