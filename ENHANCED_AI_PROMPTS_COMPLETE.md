### **AI-Generated with Enhanced Prompts**
```
Round 1: Red Light, Green Light

The colossal doll's mechanical eyes sweep across the field like searchlights of death. 
Contestants freeze in terror as the deadly game begins with mechanical precision.

Jihoon's cautious personality and high intelligence (9) serve him perfectly - his strategic 
nature allowing him to calculate each movement with methodical precision. His agility of 8 
helps him freeze instantly when the doll turns.

Minseo's aggressive nature and competitive spirit drive her forward with strength (9), but 
her low luck (3) nearly betrays her as she pushes too hard against her natural caution.

Hyejin's empathetic personality becomes her downfall - her caring nature causes her to 
glance back at struggling contestants. Despite her intelligence (8), this moment of 
compassion costs her everything as the doll's sensors detect her movement.

The loyal Hyejin falls, her strength of 4 insufficient to save her from the mechanical 
judgment of the deadly game.
```

### **Enhanced Fallback Narratives**
```
Hyejin's empathetic nature and intelligence of 8 couldn't navigate the psychological 
warfare of marbles, her deception score of 3 proving insufficient against her opponent's 
manipulation.
```
