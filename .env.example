# OpenAI API Configuration for Enhanced Narratives
#
# To enable AI-powered dynamic narratives:
# 1. Copy this file to .env (remove .example)
# 2. Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# 3. Replace the value below with your actual API key
# 4. Restart the development server
#
# The game will work without this - it will use enhanced static narratives instead
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Cost: Typically $0.001-0.002 per round (very affordable)
# Note: In production, use a backend proxy instead of exposing the API key in the browser

# Blockchain Configuration
#
# Network selection (mainnet or testnet)
VITE_NETWORK=mainnet

# Private Key for Smart Contract Deployment
# ⚠️  NEVER COMMIT THIS TO GIT! ⚠️
# 1. Export your private key from MetaMask (Account Details > Export Private Key)
# 2. Remove the '0x' prefix if present
# 3. Keep this key secure and never share it
#
PRIVATE_KEY=your_64_character_private_key_without_0x_prefix
