# 🚦 Rate Limiting Solution Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue
All Etherlink testnet RPC endpoints are experiencing heavy traffic and rate limiting. This is a temporary network congestion issue.

## ✅ Quick Solutions

### **Option 1: Wait and Retry (Recommended)**
1. **Wait 30-60 seconds** between transaction attempts
2. **Try again** - the app now automatically adds delays
3. **Be patient** - testnet traffic will decrease

### **Option 2: Manual MetaMask RPC Switch**
1. Open **MetaMask**
2. Click **Network dropdown**
3. Click **"Add Network"** or **"Edit"**
4. Try these RPC URLs one by one:
   - `https://rpc.ankr.com/etherlink_testnet`
   - `https://etherlink-testnet.rpc.thirdweb.com`
   - `https://node.ghostnet.etherlink.com`

### **Option 3: Use Different Times**
- **Early morning** (6-10 AM UTC) - less traffic
- **Late evening** (10 PM - 2 AM UTC) - less traffic
- **Avoid peak hours** (2-8 PM UTC) - high traffic

## 🔧 What We've Implemented

### **Automatic Delays**
- ✅ 2-second delay before each transaction
- ✅ Exponential backoff on retries
- ✅ Better error messages

### **Gas Optimization**
- ✅ Ultra-low gas settings (80,000 gas limit)
- ✅ 0.001 gwei gas price
- ✅ Dynamic gas estimation

### **RPC Fallbacks**
- ✅ Multiple RPC endpoints configured
- ✅ Automatic switching on failures
- ✅ Rate limiting detection

## 📊 Current Gas Settings

```typescript
gasLimit: 80000        // Very conservative
gasPrice: '1000000'    // 0.001 gwei - ultra low
```

**Expected Cost**: ~$0.0004 per transaction

## 🎯 Success Tips

1. **Wait between attempts**: Don't spam the network
2. **Check gas in MetaMask**: Manually set to ultra-low if needed
3. **Try different times**: Avoid peak hours
4. **Be patient**: Testnet congestion is temporary

## 🔍 Error Messages Explained

- **"Rate limited"**: Network is busy, wait 30 seconds
- **"Network is busy"**: All RPCs are congested, try later
- **"Gas estimation failed"**: Try manual gas settings

## 🚀 When It Works

Once you get through the rate limiting:
- ✅ **$0.04 bet** with **~$0.0004 network fee**
- ✅ **Ultra-fast transactions** on Etherlink
- ✅ **Automatic game creation** and betting

## 📞 Alternative: Local Testing

For development, consider:
1. **Local Hardhat network** for testing
2. **Different testnet** with less congestion
3. **Mainnet** (when ready) for production

The rate limiting is a temporary testnet issue and will resolve as traffic decreases! 🎉
